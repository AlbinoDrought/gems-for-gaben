			<h3>How to play:</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Drag gems on the playing field to other squares to swap them.</li>
					<li>Swap gems to get at least three in a row to gain points.</li>
					<li>You are limited by the amount of moves you make.</li>
				</ul>
				
				When you run out of moves, you can submit your score to the leaderboards.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Short Documentation:</h3>
			<p>
				<code style="line-height: 150%">
					Loader.js loads sprites, sounds, and then starts the game<br />
					The board is completely random each time. It is ensured that no matches exist on the board at the start of the game.<br />
					When a gem is swapped, it follows this order:
					<ol>
						<li>Remove control from user</li>
						<li>Check if new locations have any matches, <b>if not unswap</b></li>
						<li>Clear matches from board</li>
						<li>Make gems fall down</li>
						<li>Check matches on board</li>
						<li>Repeat at step #3 until there are no matches left</li>
					</ol>
					Sounds played are based on the current combo. As of now there are only 3 different sounds, varied in pitch and tempo.

				<code style="line-height: 150%">
				<u>Loader.js__</u><br />
				Loader.js loads all sprites, sounds, and then calls <b>Game.start()</b> when done<br />
				
				<br /><br /><u>Game.js__</u><br />
				<b>Game.start()</b> resets variables (in case it was just reset), and registers appropriate event handlers for gem swaps<br />
				When a gem swap occurs, <b>GemMouseUp()</b> is called. This detects what gem called it and where the gem should swap to.<br />
				If this is alright, it calls <b>swapGemPositions([x,y] of gem one, [x,y] of gem two)</b><br />
				
				<b>swapGemPositions</b> applies an animation (tween) to both swapping gems and waits for them to finish using a callback (<b>swapGemPositionsCallback</b>)<br />
				<b>swapGemPositionsCallback</b> moves the gems to their new positions on the grid. It checks to see if there are any matches for either gem<br />
				
				<i>If matches exist:</i>
				<ul>
					<li>Explode all matches (<b>clearMatches(matches)</b>)</li>
					<li>Fall all matched columns (<b>fallColumns(columns to fall)</b>)</li>
				</ul>
				<i>If matches don't exist:</i>
				<ul>
					<li>Undo tween animation</li>
				</ul>
				
				<b>clearMatches</b> goes through each match, adds the column to a list, and then kills the gem (explodes, create particle effect, adds to score)<br />
				<b>fallMatches</b> goes through each column starting at the bottom. When it moves up, it checks if the current spot on the grid is null (needs to fall)<br />
				
				If so, it:
				<ul>
					<li>Gets a gem that is applicable for the spot (<b>getGemToFall</b>)</li>
					<li>Sets the applicable gem's new spot on the grid so it is not over-written</li>
					<li>Animates the gem to the new position and waits for it to finish (<b>gemFallCallback</b>)</li>
				</ul>
				Otherwise, it continues going up until it is out of the grid.<br />
				
				<b>getGemToFall</b> starts at a given position and goes up until it finds a spot in the grid that is not null. It returns this gem.<br />
				<b>gemFallCallback</b> confirms the grid position and screen position, and calls <b>gemsFinishedFalling</b> if all gems are finished falling<br />
				<b>gemsFinishedFalling</b> calls <b>checkBoard</b>
				<b>checkBoard</b> goes through each gem on the board (grid), and if it has at least 2 matches (3-in-a-row) it clears those matches, starting back at swapGemPositionsCallback.<br />
				If <b>checkBoard</b> finds no matches, control is returned to the user and they can make another move.
				
				<br /><br /><u>Globals.js__</u><br />
				<b>Globals.js</b> contains global variables used across the code, including options and the grid of gems<br />
				
				<br /><br /><u>Helper.js__</u><br />
				<b>Helper.js</b> initializes the Crafty.js classes (Gem, GemDrag, Selector, HotSelector, Playspace) and contains the <b>particleExplosion</b> function
